  - Place all overridable attributes on the left of @attributes because attributes are processed right to left. If an attribute already exists, it won't update it. 
  - Alternatively, if the attribute shouldn't get overridden, place it on the right side of @attributes
  - The "value" attribute doesn't seem to be passable from parent
